		<p class="sectiontag text-big">HOW TO START BODYBUILDING FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS</p>
		<p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Everything has a starting point in life, and for lifting and bodybuilding, it’s the ground floor—there’s just no way you can start in the middle or at the top. Well consider this your go to guide on how to start bodybuilding process.<br><br>

Progress is a gradual thing, and I’ve seen so many people come into the gym and try to lift heavy right off the start only to tear a muscle and be set back a few months. So how does someone start bodybuilding? Where does your journey begin. Well first off you have to ask the real question, what are your goals? is it how to become a bodybuilder? it how do I get healthy, or is it how do I look better to pick up girls?<br><br>

If you’re just beginning with bodybuilding, then you have to have a basic plan. Take a look at your body and focus on what you really need to do to it.

		<p class="sectionsubtag text-small">It’s always great when we can take care of two things simultaneously. Life doesn’t work that way, but it can work when it comes to training. For example, many women are looking for ways to train with the goals of getting stronger and leaner.<br><br>

While this program won’t help you win a powerlifting meet or a physique show, it will help you burn a lot of calories in a short time, and you may notice that you’re getting stronger in the process. <br><br>

The program that follows will be for six weeks, three times a week. You can do it on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule, or you can take two days off between sessions. The only requirement is that you not train two days in a row. Recovery matters just as much as training, and doing a routine like this for three days in a row will wear you out quickly, which isn’t a good thing if strength and conditioning matter.

		<p class="sectiontag text-big">The Program</p>
		<p class="sectionsubtag text-small">You will train all the major muscle groups over the course of this session. Most of them have two exercises. The first will be a movement that helps you focus on strength. These are the exercises that are listed for ten reps. You’ll use the heavier weights for these and perform ten reps.<br><br>

Take your time lowering the weight, or doing the negative, and control yourself when you do the lifting portion of the positive part of the rep. <br><br>

Once you finish the tenth rep, change weights as quickly as you can so you can start the second exercise in the pairing. These are performed for 20 reps. In total, you’ll do around 250 reps from start to finish.<br><br>

Use the lighter weights for these movements. This is where the conditioning comes into play. Trying to use the same weights for all the exercises actually won’t help you. Focus on getting through all 20 reps as quickly, and safely as possible. For example, when you do the squat jumps. Get back into position after you land, but do it fast so you can perform the next jump.
